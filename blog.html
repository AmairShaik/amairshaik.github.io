<h2>How I Troubleshoot Data Issues as a Junior SQL Developer</h2>
<p>
When working in a production environment, data issues can directly impact business operations.
As a Junior SQL Developer at INARA Data Solution, my daily work involves identifying, analyzing,
and resolving data-related problems to ensure accurate reporting and system reliability.
</p>

<p>
The first step I take when an issue is reported is understanding the problem. This usually involves
reviewing error messages, checking affected reports, and confirming the data that is missing or incorrect.
</p>

<p>
I then use SQL to investigate the data and validate whether records exist, values are correct,
and whether any ETL process has failed.
</p>

<p>
Once the cause is identified, I correct the data or escalate the issue, and document the resolution.
